<p style="font-size: 30px;text"><b>That person in the picture above is me Jacob Hacker, but you still might be wondering who I really am. <br>
I am 25 year old software engineer that was born and raised in Buffalo, NY.
So what lead me down this path, well when I was in highschool I started to play video games in my free time.
Video games were a great outlet for me to relax from the everyday stresses of school. However, a small hobby turned into a great passion of mine.
After graduating highschool I knew that I wanted to find a career path that could bring my passion for video games into a real job that could change lives.
In college I knew that I was looking for some tyoe of engineering degree that would relate to my interests. That is where I discovered Computer Science.
Now I am a Software Enineer looking for new and interesting challenges in life that will allow me to grow as a developer and fix real world problems.
